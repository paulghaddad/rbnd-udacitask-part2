# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------

items for a list.

  a) Add completion status to items
  b) Add progress bar output for the percentage completed of each item

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?

I spent approximately 5-6 hours on this project.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

Learning about some pretty cool things you can do with command line apps. As far
as challenging myself, building a set of unit tests, especially around the
Completable module, was most fulfilling. I learned a lot extracting this module
and testing it in isolation.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?

I added a completed status for an item to indicate whether a todo is done or
not. This feature built for my second feature: displaying a progress bar of how
much each list is completed, as a percent.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?

I feel my biggest room for growth is object-oriented design. Any feedback in
this area is greatly appreciated.
